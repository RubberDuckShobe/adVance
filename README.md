## About
[IPA](https://github.com/Eusth/IPA) Plugin for [OLDTV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/643270/OLDTV/).
It's using .NET Framework 3.5 and is installed just like any other regular IPA plugin.
It's also built on [Kylemc1413's Beat Saber Plugin Template](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/BS-Plugin-Template/).

## Features
- Razer Chroma Support (shows current color, colored arrow keys)
- Refresh rate of up to 300FPS

## Installation
Refer to [adVance's Wiki](https://github.com/RubberDuckShobe/adVance/wiki) for a detailed guide on how to install adVance.

## Planned Features
Keep in mind that there's a possibility that some of these features might not be added depending on neccessity and how difficult adding them is.
- The ability to get the current continent
- 4:3 resolution support
- Discord Rich Presence (unlikely, reconsidering)
- Improve Razer Chroma Support (more features)

## Why?
To learn C#, Unity game modding/developing and to make OLDTV even better.
It's an awesome free game which deserves much more love and attention.

## Special Thanks
Special thanks to the folks over on the [Beat Saber Modding Group Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) for answering my beginner Unity questions, without them this wouldn't have been possible at all!
