## About
[IPA](https://github.com/Eusth/IPA) Plugin for [OLDTV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/643270/OLDTV/).
It's using .NET Framework 3.5 and is installed just like any other regular IPA plugin.
It's also built on [Kylemc1413's Beat Saber Plugin Template](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/BS-Plugin-Template/).

## Features
- Chroma Connect support! (Lights up your entire gaming setup with the current color ingame or even your ENTIRE ROOM if you have Philips Hue lights, unsure if it works with Nanoleaf)
- Razer Chroma peripheral support (Shows current color in keys F1-F12, mouse wheel, mouse backlight, mouse logo, left/right arrow keys and mouse LED stripes in green and red)
- Custom refresh rate cap defined by the config file, making it possible to play the game at 144FPS or higher (Unmodded base game max setting is 120FPS)
- Can get current color of game text, current game mode, current frequency and more soon™
- Config system (Taken from [Beat Saber Utils](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/Beat-Saber-Utils)) which makes it possible to set custom refresh rates, custom resolutions, Razer Chroma lighting mode [and more](https://github.com/RubberDuckShobe/adVance/wiki/The-config-file-and-its-functions)!
- Discord Rich Presence (Shows current game status, game mode and time playing on Discord)

## Installation
Refer to [adVance's Wiki](https://github.com/RubberDuckShobe/adVance/wiki) for a detailed guide on how to install adVance.

## Planned Features
Keep in mind that there's a possibility that some of these features might not be added depending on neccessity and how difficult adding them is.
- The ability to get the current continent
- Add to Razer Chroma integration (Maybe something to indicate the current continent)

## Why?
To learn C#, Unity game modding/developing and to make OLDTV even better.
It's an awesome free game which deserves much more love and attention.

## Special Thanks
Special thanks to the folks over on the [Beat Saber Modding Group Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) (for answering my beginner Unity questions and helping with other stuff), without them this wouldn't have been possible at all!
