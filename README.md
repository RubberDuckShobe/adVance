## About
[IPA](https://github.com/Eusth/IPA) Plugin for [OLDTV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/643270/OLDTV/).
It's using .NET Framework 3.5 and is installed just like any other regular IPA plugin.
It's also built on [Kylemc1413's Beat Saber Plugin Template](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/BS-Plugin-Template/).

## Why?
To learn C#, Unity game modding and to make OLDTV even better.
It's an awesome free game which deserves much more love and attention.

## Installation
Install IPA. Refer to the guide on the [IPA GitHub repository](https://github.com/Eusth/IPA) in the README.md file for installing IPA.
Get a release from the [releases page](https://github.com/RubberDuckShobe/adVance/releases).
Open the directory the game is installed in and put the contents of the .zip file in the Plugins folder that IPA created in the game's root directory. **Do not put them inside V_Data/Plugins! It won't work!**

## Features
- Razer Chroma Support
