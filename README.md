## About
[IPA](https://github.com/Eusth/IPA) Plugin for [OLDTV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/643270/OLDTV/).
It's using .NET Framework 3.5 and is installed just like any other regular IPA plugin.
It's also built on [Kylemc1413's Beat Saber Plugin Template](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/BS-Plugin-Template/).

## Features
- Razer Chroma Link support! (Lights up your entire gaming setup with the current color ingame or even your ENTIRE ROOM if you have Philips Hue lights, unsure if it works with Nanoleaf)
- Razer Chroma peripheral support (Shows current color in keys F1-F12, colored arrow keys in green and red)
- Refresh rate of up to 300FPS
- Can get current color of game text and more soonâ„¢

## Installation
Refer to [adVance's Wiki](https://github.com/RubberDuckShobe/adVance/wiki) for a detailed guide on how to install adVance.

## Planned Features
Keep in mind that there's a possibility that some of these features might not be added depending on neccessity and how difficult adding them is.
- The ability to get the current continent
- Discord Rich Presence
- Add to Razer Chroma integration (Add support for Saturn colors and maybe something to indicate the current continent)

## Why?
To learn C#, Unity game modding/developing and to make OLDTV even better.
It's an awesome free game which deserves much more love and attention.

## Special Thanks
Special thanks to the folks over on the [Beat Saber Modding Group Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) (for answering my beginner Unity questions and helping with other stuff), without them this wouldn't have been possible at all!
